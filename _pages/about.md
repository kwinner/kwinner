I am a researcher interested in developing novel machine learning algorithms motivated by important problems in population ecology. I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst advised by [Dr. Dan Sheldon](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sheldon/).

On the machine learning side, my primary research interests are in graphical models and probabilistic inference. On the ecological side, my primary research interests are in population ecology and animal movement modeling. I am also actively involved in the growing field of [Computational Sustainability](http://www.compsust.net/), which encompasses many such interdisciplinary research efforts. 

My current projects include probabilistic inference for latent variables with countably infinite support (particularly time series of abundance) applied to moth, butterfly and salamander datasets and a continent-scale model of bird migration using Doppler weather radar data.
